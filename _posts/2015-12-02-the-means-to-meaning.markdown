We're these unbelievably complicated brains

Drifting through a void,

Trying in vain to connect with one another

By blindly fling words out into darkness.

You can never know for sure

What ANY words will mean to ANYONE.

All you can do is try to get better at

Guessing how your words affect people,

So you can have a chance of finding the ones

That will make them feel

Something like what you want them to feel.
